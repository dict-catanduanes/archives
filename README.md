To fulfill its mission and vision, the DICT is offering various programs and projects in cooperation with other departments of the Philippine government. The DICT Catanduanes Region V Bicol has implemented multiple projects such as cyber security, digital jobs, DRRM, DTC, Free WIFI for all, ILCDB, BPLS, PNPKI, SPARK, TECH4ED, and eGOV.PH. The scope of this project is limited to the Catanduanes Provincial Office. Given that multiple programs and projects have been implemented, the DICT Catanduanes aims to create a simple database system for each project and to monitor the activities implemented thereof. Also, this system is for the admin only of the DICT.

This system aims to provide the curated programs and activities implemented by the DICT Catanduanes, Region V Bicol.  In addition, it is intended to make the information readily available for the admin anytime and anywhere given that they have internet connection. This will allow the admin to pinpoint the specific activity needed and retrieve information within.
